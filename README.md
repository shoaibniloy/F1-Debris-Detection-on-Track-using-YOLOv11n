# F1-Debris-Detection-on-Track-using-YOLOv11n
This project uses YOLOv11n for real-time object detection on F1 tracks. It detects debris, recovery vehicles, and marshals to enhance race safety. The model was tested on 1080p F1 POV video, successfully identifying high-speed flying debris and stationary hazards to improve race conditions.
